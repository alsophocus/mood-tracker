**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview
Implementing Material Design 3 improvements to enhance user experience and data visualization.

## Phase 1: Weekly Patterns with Week Navigation ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Complexity**: MEDIUM  
**Risk**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED AND TESTED

### Current State
- Year/Month/Week dropdowns (confusing)
- Week-of-month concept is unclear
- No easy way to navigate between weeks

### Target State
- Simple Previous/Next week buttons
- Date range display (e.g., "Oct 16 - Oct 22, 2025")
- Line graph showing daily averages (Mon-Sun)
- Colored dots based on mood values
- Variable dot sizes (more entries = bigger dots)
- Gaps in line where no data exists
- Enhanced tooltips with average, mood name, entry count

### Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Update backend route to accept `start_date` parameter
2. ✅ Modify `get_weekly_patterns_for_period()` to return null for no-data days
3. ✅ Add counts array for entry tracking
4. ⏳ Replace HTML dropdowns with navigation buttons
5. ⏳ Add JavaScript for week navigation
6. ⏳ Update chart rendering with colored dots
7. ⏳ Test thoroughly before moving to next phase

### Files to Modify
- `routes.py` - Add start_date support
- `analytics.py` - Update get_weekly_patterns_for_period
- `templates/index.html` - Replace controls, add JS functions

### Testing Checklist

## Phase 5: Monthly Trends Enhancement ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority**: LOW  
**Complexity**: LOW  
**Risk**: LOW  
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED AND TESTED (Oct 22, 2025)

### Current State
- Showed monthly averages (good foundation)

### Target State
- Keep current functionality
- Add trend line overlay showing linear regression
- Show improvement/declining indicators
- Display trend direction and slope information

### Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Create TrendAnalysisService with linear regression calculation
2. ✅ Enhance /monthly_trends endpoint with trend data
3. ✅ Add trend line overlay to existing chart
4. ✅ Add trend indicator with direction and change percentage
5. ✅ Apply Material Design 3 styling to trend indicators

### Files Modified

- **Liskov Substitution**: Service implements consistent interface
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused on trend analysis concerns only
- **Dependency Inversion**: Route depends on service abstraction

### Testing Checklist
